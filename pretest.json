    {
      "question": "How does Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) simplify privilege management in databases?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By assigning permissions directly to every user individually.",
        "b": "By grouping permissions into roles and assigning those roles to users.",
        "c": "By allowing users to select their own permissions.",
        "d": "By storing access rights in an external file system."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Assigning permissions individually increases complexity.",
        "b": "Correct. RBAC organizes permissions into roles for efficient management.",
        "c": "Incorrect. RBAC does not allow users to choose permissions.",
        "d": "Incorrect. RBAC operates at the database level, not the file system."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",

    },
    {
      "question": "Which scenario best demonstrates the use of RBAC?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Every user has full access to all tables.",
        "b": "Managers can update reports while interns can only view them.",
        "c": "All users share one common login.",
        "d": "All users have identical permissions regardless of job role."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Full access violates least privilege.",
        "b": "Correct. RBAC assigns permissions based on job roles.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Shared logins reduce accountability.",
        "d": "Incorrect. RBAC provides differentiated access."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which principle is enforced by RBAC to limit unnecessary access?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Data normalization",
        "b": "Principle of least privilege",
        "c": "Data redundancy reduction",
        "d": "Open access principle"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Normalization is unrelated to access control.",
        "b": "Correct. RBAC ensures users get only the permissions they need.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Redundancy relates to storage.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Access is restricted, not opened."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "How are access rights updated in RBAC when a user changes departments?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The admin reassigns the user to a new role, updating permissions automatically.",
        "b": "The user must request permissions one by one.",
        "c": "All old permissions are retained permanently.",
        "d": "The user must create a new account for the new role."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. RBAC enables easy role reassignment.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Manual updates are not needed in RBAC.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Permissions depend on the current role.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A single account can be reassigned."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key advantage of RBAC for large organizations?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It provides scalable control by assigning permissions through roles.",
        "b": "It allows employees to change their own permissions freely.",
        "c": "It works without any administrative configuration.",
        "d": "It automatically performs data encryption."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. RBAC scales well with large user groups.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Only administrators change permissions.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Admins define roles and mappings.",
        "d": "Incorrect. RBAC does not handle encryption."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a security risk of an incorrectly configured RBAC system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Users may end up with more privileges than required.",
        "b": "Database performance may slightly improve.",
        "c": "All roles will automatically balance their permissions.",
        "d": "Users will lose access to the system permanently."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Misconfigured roles can lead to privilege escalation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. RBAC issues typically do not affect performance.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Role permissions must be defined manually.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Over-permission is more common than total lockout."
