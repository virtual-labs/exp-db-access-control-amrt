- Click **Test Access** and observe the result:  
  -  **Access Granted** — The user’s role includes the required permission.  
  -  **Access Denied** — The user’s role does not include the required permission.  

- Review the **Access Log** for details such as the user, assigned role, action, and timestamp.
